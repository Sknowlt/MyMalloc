# My Malloc

My Malloc is an implementation of a basic form of malloc for use in an academic setting. The lab was supplied in an Operating Systems Kernels course at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

This lab introduced a variety of methods to manipulate individual bits through the use of bit masking using preprocessor directives. Using these masks as well as specific flags, we were required create only a few functions to aid in the efficiency of the pre-implemented malloc. This included functionality to handle the freeing of memory blocks, reallocation of blocks to fit additional blocks, as well as a method to coalesce similar blocks. This aided in a benchmark of how efficient the malloc was through a test driver program provided by the professor. The higher the efficiency, the higher the grade.

Unfortunately, this code is unable to be compiled as it is missing the required 32-bit libraries.

Please read the COURSE_README.md to learn more about the lab as well as the copyright. This README is my own work, but the rest of the lab was created by and belongs solely to R. Bryant and D. O'Hallaron.
